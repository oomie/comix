•	Project Name: City Tripping (Maya in AD)

•	Project Description: Maya, the main character, is a college student who was feeling a bit down after a long week of assignments and deadlines. She receives a text from her friend, Beena, to go on a city trip together. Despite her initial moodiness, Maya ends up having a lot of fun in the city and feels refreshed when they return to the campus in the evening.

•	Process: We divided the drawing for 3 members - Dilnaz p.1,2 – Yeva p.3,4 – Toomie p.5. Toomie worked on the coding of pages 1 and 2. Bato worked on the coding and interaction of the last 3 pages. Interaction elements and additions to the panels were: white borders, louvre and ferrari logos, blurred images, aos, howler.js click-on sounds, and jquery click-on image replacements.

•	Reflection/Evaluation: Our expactation was met to a certain extent. All members did a good job on drawing and delivering on the initial concepts. The drawing style was relatively consistent across different pages. If we had more time on the coding, we might’ve added more polished and sophisticated interactions. But still, we managed to implement a sizeable amount of interaction within a relatively short time.

# Documentation of the process (Copied from the Google doc)

Note from Bato: Please draw each character, background, as well as balloon text in separate layers so we can make adjustments easier later-on. This also applies to items you’d like to use for interactivity or animation.
